                  You're sick and tired of reading betting stories that seem
                  unrealistic, and you're just looking for a way to earn a
                  modest annual income by betting from home; then listen
                  carefully for the next 5 minutes, as I explain precisely how I
                  managed to become a full-time punter without some miracle

                  The horse betting business is a place where you learn how to
                  risk money to make money, in a practical and healthy way…
                  However in this business there are a lot of losers that don’t
                  respect the craft, and just gamble.

                  You don’t place a hundred quid on Sheikh Mohammed’s horse
                  because you “believe in his training methodology” or because

                  <br /><br />
                  You want a passive income that can supplement what you already
                  have. A steady but growing bank that can cover that debt or
                  get you to that holiday resort in Tenerife.

                  So far, you have wasted your time online and nothing has
                  worked.
                  <br /><br />
                  You have scoured through tedious systems and gone back and
                  forth with the overpromising tipsters just to end up with less
                  in your bank account than when you started.
                  <br /><br />
                  I’d like to present you with a slightly different approach
                  that has worked wonders for me.

            <li>Betting on jumps</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I knew that there were people out there reaping the rewards of
            betting but they were definitely not going about it the way did.
            <br />
            <br />
            All these sales pages with smiley tipsters didn’t feel like the real

            So like everyone else, I joined forums and made contacts with other
            punters and industry heads who were all on that never ending quest
            to betting riches.
            <br />
            <br />
            By the way, if you haven’t done this yet, I advise you to sign up to
            OLBG or Punters Lounge as there are people on there with decades of
            experience that might be able to give you that missing piece of your
            puzzle.

            <span>That’s how I got my lucky strike.</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            I came across a guy on a thread who worked for an Israeli bookmaker.
            <br />
            <br />
            I’d love to tell you which one but I’d be breaching their terms and
            conditions which could get my site shut down so Imma leave that out
            for now.
            <br />
            <br />
            We became quite close and I started Skyping him every now and again
            to ask those aggravating question like: <span class="italicBold">Who is creating those odds
              that bookmakers publish?</span>
            <br />
            <br />
           <span class="italicBold"> Why do odds drop or rise so quickly? And which market is best to bet
            on?</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            He seemed to be quite open and he always answered me fairly which
            was surprising.
            <br />
            <br />
            Until now, I think its because we both were family men. Although we
            had no business talking to each other, it always broke the ice.
            <br />
            <br />
            The purpose of everything we did was to improve the lives of our
            family, and it remains the same today.

            There was a time when I was the most risky bettor!

            And we have all been there (or maybe you’re still there):

            <br /><br />
            Trying to turn £50 into £150 on the same day.
            <br /><br />
            No real understanding of bank management.
            <br /><br />
            More Often Than Not, My £50 Investment Would Go Up To £150 Monday -
            Only To Hit £0.00 By Wednesday Tea Time!
            <br /><br />
            My assumption was that if I won just one 10/1 a week with an average
            of 10 bets a week, I would break even.
            <br /><br />
            So my logic meant 2 winning days per week would suffice to get solid
            profits.
            <br /><br />
            And with the advent of machine learning in the late 2010’s I felt
            like I could make this idea a reality.
            <br /><br />
            Here was my ill-advised approach:

            <br /><br />
            My logic didn’t work..
            <br /><br />
            In a short time I was nearly £1,200 down and scratching my head?!
            <br /><br />
            All 3 of the systems had made us a little money for at least 6
            months, and had come from 3 very different sources and styles of
            betting.
            <br /><br />
            However all that glitters is not gold. They soon saw a downtrend.

            I took the initiative to contact an expert in the field of my
            endeavour.
            <br /><br />
            It was an old mate who studied Finance and had based his
            dissertation on probability.
            <br /><br />
            His hypothesis was that the maximum betting profit is derived from
            dissecting the form in minute detail.
            <br /><br />
            And I mean hours upon hours worth of investigating data to look for
            horses with an advantage that the general betting public doesn't
            see.
            <br /><br />
            <span class="italicNormal">After preliminary shortlisting…</span>
            <br /><br />
            … Deep form study, or more specifically selection analysis, can
            whittle down a long list of selections to the best bets

            So that faithful summer in August 2020 we made the key decision that
            changed everything
            <br /><br />
            We threw away all of my systems and kept only the most consistent
            one.
            <br /><br />
            After finishing my day job as a security guard, we would spend 4-5
            hours analyzing horse racing data in the most in-depth and advanced
            way possible.
            <br /><br />
            We were scraping through:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Live text commentaries</li>
            <li>Deep historical data</li>
            <li>Cumulative stats</li>
            <li>Horse racing results</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Instead of taking other people's betting systems and using that as a
            foundation, I was going to the source and doing it myself.
            <br /><br />
            Andrew Beyer, Ken Ostermann, and Richard Eng were a few of the horse
            racing authors who educated me get through this period
          </p>

          <p class="weekText">
            On week 1 we hit 2 different 10/1 winners and 5 losses. That’s 15pts
            profit!
            <br /><br />
            In place of trying to pick a horse based on narrow criteria, we
            could simply use the software to finely comb through data and find
            that needle in the haystack
            <br /><br />
            After this switch, I experienced the biggest upswing in any of our
            betting careers.
            <br /><br />
            A stunning X winners in just 17 days left us (and most certainly my
            wife) gobsmacked!
          </p>

            Rather than following trends, constantly buying systems and seeing
            what is happening on all forums we were just doing our own thing.
            <br /><br />
            And yes, it is time consuming! <br> At times, I can spend up to 60+ hours
            a week!
            <br /><br />
            But I am loving it.
